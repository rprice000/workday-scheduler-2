## Description
This weekâ€™s Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate week day scheduler. This app will use HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript as well as CDNs from JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. The app will update automatically to reflect what work is currently due, past due, or about to be due each hour of each day. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
